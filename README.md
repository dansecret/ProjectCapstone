# Project Capstone

This project was developed as part of the Bangkit 2023 program and focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. The project involves data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation to deliver impactful and actionable results.

## Objectives
- Collect and preprocess relevant datasets.
- Develop a machine learning model using CNN architectures.
- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics.
- Provide predictions to classify outcomes, such as "Healthy" or "Not_Healthy," based on the dataset.

## Features
- **Data Preparation**: Splitting datasets into training and testing subsets for effective learning.
- **Model Development**: Implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classification tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy-based performance assessment to ensure model reliability.
- **Practical Application**: Classification outcomes for informed decision-making in relevant fields.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
